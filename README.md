## Dev

Make sure you have a modern version of Node + NPM installed (5.x and 3.x, respectively.)

After that, just install the NPM dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Extras

You might want to have [react-devtools](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/09/02/new-react-developer-tools.html) installed in your browser.
